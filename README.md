An end-to-end system for evaluating grammar quality in spoken English using acoustic features and NLP analysis.
## Overview
This project aims to develop a Grammar Scoring Engine that analyzes audio recordings to predict grammar quality scores (0-5) based on both acoustic features and transcribed text. The solution leverages audio processing, NLP techniques, and machine learning to evaluate spoken grammar proficiency.
